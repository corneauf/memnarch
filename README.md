# Memnarch, dotfiles watcher

Memnarch is a personal project of mine to help standardize my development environment across computers.
This means it needs to handle different OS and different architectures. So far, it will install all targets
from source and put the binaries under `~/.memnarch/bin`. Correctly, it maintains my installations of 

- make
- cmake
- zsh
- neovim

Still needs to add caching as well as configuration file tracking.
